Arduino_Simple_AT_Command
===========================
This is a really interesting little project. It has two parts. One is a little Arduino AT command server and the other one is a Python GUI control panel.

It is very common we need to adjust soem parameters inside our working MCU. Uploding the program every time is not very convenient. Try your own serial AT commands by using this AT Command Read Example. I also provide a pyQT GUI script. Allows you a much quciker and more automated control method.
